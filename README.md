## Why this Project?

We chose to create this project, based on familiarity with similar system that was deemed intuitive enough to start with a challengeing outcome towards the end. a perfect blend
## How does this work?

The program strives to mimic a typical online system one would use to view reading material for availability and claim it for a certain period of time before returning it

- If the book in question is available for borrowing, the librarian can sign the book out to the particular borrower, if not available then the borrower must wait for the return date.

- THe libarian has the authority to add and remove books, the borrow may only sign out books, should the books be available as mentioned previously

- ## How to log in

- The client will first need to register into the system by providing the relevant information to sign into the homepage

- If the prerequistes to register have been succesful, the user need only provide the approved login credentials and begin browsing the selections available

- When the user decides on a book they wish to borrow, they need only click on the borrow button beside the desired book, the book will be signed to the user for a period of two weeks

- 

## How to run it 

-To run, download the repo to your machine, run the servlet from your IDE of choice.
- in your web browser of choice, type http://localhost:8080/login

- from there, please set up a login for yourself, your password should be a capital, a special character and a number and exceed the minimum character requirement

- Once you have successfully logged in, you are free to browse what books are available for you to borrow!

- Remember to return what books you have borrowed, over due fews are never a good thing to have on your record!

- If you have any overdue books on your profile, the system will notify you of the overdue books.
